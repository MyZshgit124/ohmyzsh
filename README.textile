You are on the @master@ branch. I use it for my own OMZ installs, it is usually pretty close to upstream, you are welcome to take inspiration but I will not allow external changes.

h3. Tracking

The "@upstream-edge@ branch":https://github.com/ncanceill/oh-my-zsh/tree/upstream-edge tracks the bleeding edge upstream. It is used as a clean starting point for new Pull Requests.

h3. Testing

The "@upstream-test@ branch":https://github.com/ncanceill/oh-my-zsh/tree/upstream-test holds changes that need testing before merging.

h3. Updating

These branches are used to aggregate Pull Requests into categories. Please submit them to these branches, if applicable, instead of sending them directly upstream. This allows to keep the original repository clean.
