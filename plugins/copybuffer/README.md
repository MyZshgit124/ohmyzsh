# `copybuffer` plugin

This plugin adds a keybinding that copies the text that is currently typed in
the command line (the buffer) to the system clipboard.

This is useful if you type a command - and before you hit enter to execute it - want
to copy it maybe so you can paste it into a script, gist or whatnot.

```zsh
plugins=(... copybuffer)
```
