# mix-fast

Fast mix autocompletion plugin.

This script caches the output for later usage and significantly speeds it up.
It generates a .mix_tasks cache file for current project. Currently if you want
to update cache you should remove .mix_tasks file

Inspired by and based on rake-fast zsh plugin.
