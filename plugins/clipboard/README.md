# clipboard plugin

This plugin integrates zsh kill-ring with system clipboard.

It makes it possible to kill in zsh and paste into browser/editor or vice versa.

Key bindings that rebound by the plugin are `C-y`, `C-k`, `C-u`, `M-d`, `M-backspace` and `M-w`.

The plugin should not change behaviour of these keys.
