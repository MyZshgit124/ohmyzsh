# ProQuotes (Programming Quotes) Plugin

This plugin decorates your terminal with a nice programming quote every time you start a new session.

To use, add `proquotes` to the list of plugins in your `.zshrc` file:

`plugins=(... proquotes)`

Then, re-open your terminal and get the motivation you need to CRUSH IT!
