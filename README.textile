A handful of functions, auto-complete helpers, and stuff that makes you shout...

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

This is forked from http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

h2. Setup

h3. The manual install


1. Clone the repository

  @git clone http://github.com/squarepegsys/oh-my-zsh.git  ~/.oh-my-zsh@

2. Create a new zsh config by copying the zsh template we've provided.

  *NOTE*: If you already have a ~/.zshrc file, you should back it up. @cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig@ in case you want to go back to your original settings.

  @cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc@

3. Set zsh as your default shell:

  @chsh -s /bin/zsh@

4. Start / restart zsh (open a new terminal is easy enough..)

h3. Problems?

You _might_ need to modify your PATH in ~/.zshrc if you're not able to find some commands after switching to oh-my-zsh.

h2. Usage

TODO: Update this..

* auto rehash
* Put in Terminal configurator for those strange terminal settings
* easier support for more SCM's (now it's mostly Git)
* Have different zsh on the same machine share history
* Put in some Django shortcuts
* More to come

h2. Useful

the "refcard":http://www.bash2zsh.com/zsh_refcard/refcard.pdf is pretty tasty for tips.

h3. Customization

If you want to override any of the default behavior, just add a new file (ending in @.zsh@) into the @custom/@ directory.

h3. Uninstalling

If you want to uninstall it, just run @uninstall_oh_my_zsh@ from the command line and it'll remove itself and revert you to bash (or your previous zsh config).

h2. Thanks

* Robby Russell  for starting this project in the first place
* Rick Olson (technoweenie) might remember some of the configuration, which I took from a pastie a few years ago.
* Marcel (noradio) provided Rick the original zsh configuration.
* Nicholas (ulysses) for the "rake autocompletion code":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/3/9/fast-rake-task-completion-for-zsh.

h2. Help out!

I just quote robbyrussel:

bq. I'm far from being a zsh-expert and suspect there are many ways to improve. If you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!

I would love more advance yet nice ZSH stuff\
