## Contributing

You can [fetch](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository in order to [participate in testing](#testing) or [aggregate pull requests](#updating) for upstream.

## Branches

There are various branches used to help with maintenance.

You are on the **master** branch. I use it for my own OMZ installs, it is usually pretty close to upstream, you are welcome to take inspiration but I will not allow external changes.

### Tracking

The [**upstream-edge** branch](https://github.com/ncanceill/oh-my-zsh/tree/upstream-edge) tracks the bleeding edge upstream. It is used as a clean starting point for new Pull Requests.

### Testing

The [**upstream-test** branch](https://github.com/ncanceill/oh-my-zsh/tree/upstream-test) holds changes that need testing before merging.

### Updating

These branches are used to aggregate Pull Requests into categories. Please submit your PRs to these branches, if applicable, instead of sending them directly upstream. This allows to keep the original repository clean.
