Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.

Sounds boring. Let's try again.

__Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one.__

Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town _or your money back!_ With each keystroke in your command prompt, you'll take advantage of the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes. Strangers will come up to you in cafÃ©s and ask you, _"that is amazing! are you some sort of genius?"_

Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you have always felt you deserved. ...or maybe you'll use the time that you're saving to start flossing more often. ðŸ˜¬

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A Unix-like operating system: macOS, Linux, BSD. On Windows: WSL is preferred, but cygwin or msys also mostly work.
* [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent). If not pre-installed (run `zsh --version` to confirm), check the following instructions here: [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
* `git` should be installed

#### Installation

##### 1. Clone the repository + submodules:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vavalm/ohmyzsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
```

##### 2. take existing `~/.zshrc` file:

```shell
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

##### 3. Change your default shell

```shell
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### Uninstalling Oh My Zsh

Oh My Zsh isn't for everyone. We'll miss you, but we want to make this an easy breakup.

If you want to uninstall `oh-my-zsh`, just run `uninstall_oh_my_zsh` from the command-line. It will remove itself and revert your previous `bash` or `zsh` configuration.
