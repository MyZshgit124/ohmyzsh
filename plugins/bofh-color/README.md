# Bastard Operator from Hell run by @grauhut

A bit of fun to lighten up your day. Get a Error-Message whenever you open your Terminal and by running `bofh`.

Pay a visit to bofh.tips and follow @grauhut on Twitter. 

Note: This is the version that requires lolcat. Each message is displayed with random rainbows.
