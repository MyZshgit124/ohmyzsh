## Racket Plugin

This [racket plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/racket)
adds completion support for the racket and raco tools used to develop software
in the [Racket language](https://racket-lang.org/).

The original completion script is maintained [here](https://github.com/racket/shell-completion/blob/master/racket-completion.zsh).
