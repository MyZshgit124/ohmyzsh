# Custom zsh configuration files can be added here. You can add a
# single file or organize related commands into separate files. The
# init script loads the files in the custom/ directory alphabetically.
#
# Example: add shortcuts to projects you often work on.

# brainstormr=~/Projects/development/planetargon/brainstormr
# cd $brainstormr
