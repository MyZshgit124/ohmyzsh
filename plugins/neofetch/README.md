## neofetch

**Maintainer:** [@ybalrid](https://github.com/ybalrid)

This plugins just run the `neofetch` command when you open a new prompt

### Usage

Just install neofetch and activate that plugin in your `.zshrc`. This is a compromize between eye candy and speed, but some people do that, so why not automate that configuration. :wink:
