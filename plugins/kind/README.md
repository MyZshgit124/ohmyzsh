[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes". 

kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

To use it, add `kind` to the plugins array of your zshrc file:

```sh
plugins=(... kind)
```
