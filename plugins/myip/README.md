# Goal
This adds a simple command to find out your current public IPv4 address

# Requirements
* connection to the internet using a IPv4 address

# Usage
Type "myip" and get a line with your public IPv4 address back. Useful for
bugfixing, ssh-ing to your parents computer and more ;-)

This uses dig and opendns.com and is really nothing more than a convenient
wrapper for not very complex command.
