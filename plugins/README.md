# Oh My Zsh Plugins

Oh My Zsh comes with nearly 300 plugins for enhancing command and parameter completion for various languages and other conveniences.
These are maintained in the [plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins) directory and and also listed on the [wiki](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins).

## Enabling Plugins

This document provides a quick synopsis of some featured plugin.

Once you spot a plugin (or several) that you'd like to use with Oh My Zsh, you'll need to enable them in the `~/.zshrc` file, under the configuration for . You'll find the zshrc file in your `$HOME` directory. Open it with your favorite text editor and you'll see a spot to list all the plugins you want to load.

```shell
# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
# Standard plugins can be found at ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*
# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
plugins=( git osx python)
```
