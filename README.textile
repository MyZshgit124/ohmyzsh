A handful of functions, auto-complete helpers, and stuff that makes you shout...

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

This is forked from http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

h2. Setup

h3. The manual install


1. Clone the repository

  @git clone http://github.com/squarepegsys/oh-my-zsh.git  ~/.oh-my-zsh@

2. Create a new zsh config by copying the zsh template we've provided.

  *NOTE*: If you already have a ~/.zshrc file, you should back it up. @cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig@ in case you want to go back to your original settings.

  @cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc@

3. Set zsh as your default shell:

  @chsh -s /bin/zsh@

4. Start / restart zsh (open a new terminal is easy enough...)

h3. Features different than robbyrussel's version

* Option to configure a terminal with strange settings (labor intensive on the first run, perfectly wonderful after that.)
* Will automatically rehash the path, so new commands will be found immediately
* Added realias to quickly make a new shell alias/function (EDITOR env variable required)
* Removed upgrade checker
* share history with your zsh's on the same host

h3. Problems?

You _might_ need to modify your PATH in ~/.zshrc if you're not able to find some commands after switching to _Oh My Zsh_.



h2. Usage

TODO: Update this..

* easier support for more SCM's (now it's mostly Git)
* Have different zsh on the same machine share history
* Put in some Django shortcuts
* More to come

h2. Useful

the "refcard":http://www.bash2zsh.com/zsh_refcard/refcard.pdf is pretty tasty for tips.

h3. Customization

If you want to override any of the default behavior, just add a new file (ending in @.zsh@) into the @custom/@ directory.
If you have many functions which go good together you can put them as a *.plugin.zsh file in the @plugin/@ directory and then enable this plugin.

h3. Uninstalling

If you want to uninstall it, just run @uninstall_oh_my_zsh@ from the command line and it'll remove itself and revert you to bash (or your previous zsh config).

h2. Thanks

* Robby Russell  for starting this project in the first place

h2. Help out!

I just quote robbyrussel:

bq. I'm far from being a zsh-expert and suspect there are many ways to improve. If you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!

I would love more advance yet nice ZSH stuff
